## 🌟 How O-Vision Works

**O-Vision** breaks down complex algorithms into visual representations that are easy to follow. Simply choose an algorithm, define your input size, and watch the magic unfold:

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Pick from sorting algorithms like **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and more, or explore **graph algorithms** like **Dijkstra’s**.
2. **Customizable Input Sizes**: Choose how big the dataset should be and see how performance scales.
3. **Watch Complexity Grow**: Observe real-time changes in time and space complexity as input sizes increase, accompanied by visual data graphs.
4. **Compare Algorithms**: Select multiple algorithms to see how their complexities compare across various input sizes.

## ✨ Upcoming Features

- 🔍 **Graph Traversal Visualizer**: Dive into algorithms like BFS and DFS with an interactive graph explorer.
- 📈 **Advanced Analysis Mode**: Explore detailed metrics on memory usage and CPU performance.
- 🧠 **Algorithm Challenges**: Solve real-world problems and learn how different algorithms perform under pressure.
- 💾 **Save & Share**: Save your visualizations and share them with others!

## 🎯 Purpose

**O-Vision** aims to be the ultimate resource for students, engineers, and anyone looking to understand how algorithms work under the hood. Forget the complicated math – just dive in and see how different algorithms perform in real time!
